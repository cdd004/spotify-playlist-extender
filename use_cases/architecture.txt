Our webapp will run be designed on the basis of client-server architectural principles, using angular javascript. Every user will interact with the app on their own client, which in turn will make calls to our application server. This is the right choice since we just have simple interactions between the client and the server. There is no user to user interaction, little data to manage, and no subscriptions to publish changes to. Because our project does not involve a large data store and doing operations involving this data, we do not believe that a data centric architecture would be right for our goals.
