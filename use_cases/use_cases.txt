Use Cases

1. User connects to their Spotify account (Joe)
  As a user, I want to be able to go to the webapp (url) and then use a widget to log into my Spotify account.

2. User browses through their list of playlists, decides to add a certain amount of songs (Cullen)
  As a user, I will want to extend one of my playlists by adding similar songs to it. After selecting one of the playlists, I can choose the number of songs to be added, and the app will then return a list of songs matching the number I put in.

3. User can preview/listen to the returned songs before saving them (Joe)
  As a user, when the webapp returns a list of songs that are a good fit for a selected playlist, I want to be able to listen to a "preview" or a short snippet of each song so I can decide whether I like the song/ want to add it to a new playlist. 

4. User can select to add all/certain songs to their existing playlist (Steven)
 A user sees songs he likes from the playlist generated from Use Case #3. The user can check individual songs that he wishes to add to his playlist, or select the "check all" button for easier convenience. After confirming he has checked off all the desired songs, he can then proceed to add them to his playlist.

5. User can confirm their additions and save the playlist (Spencer)
